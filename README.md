## Description

This application lets you manage your spends. You can add some, delete and see a summary of your spends. You can use Euros, Dollars and Mexican Pesos as the initial project was for a friend who is going to Mexico.  
It is written in PHP for the backend part and HTML/CSS for the frontend, with a little bit of Javascript for a trick.

## How to use

* Go to the website : https://simon-test-romane.wuaze.com/index.php?i=1
* Enjoy the interface in French :)
* You can add spends in the first section, then see a summary with some statistics in the second part and then all the spends in the database, where you can delete them too.
